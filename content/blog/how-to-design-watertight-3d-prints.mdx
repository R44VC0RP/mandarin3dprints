Whether you're printing a custom vase, a planter box, a soap dish, or a housing for electronics that might encounter moisture, getting your 3D print to hold water is trickier than it looks. Those tiny gaps between layers that are invisible to the eye? They're the enemy of watertight prints.

The good news: with the right combination of design choices, print settings, and material selection, you can create FDM prints that genuinely hold liquids. Here's everything that actually works.

## Why FDM Prints Leak (And It's Not Just Layer Lines)

FDM printing creates parts by stacking layers of melted plastic. Each layer bonds to the one below it, but that bond isn't perfectly solid. Microscopic gaps exist between layers, between perimeter lines, and where infill meets walls.

Water finds these paths. Even if your print looks solid, a filled vase often develops wet spots on the outside over a few hours as water wicks through micro-channels in the print.

Understanding this is the first step: you're not trying to make plastic waterproof (it already is). You're trying to eliminate the tiny gaps where water can travel through your part.

## Material Selection: Start With the Right Filament

Your material choice significantly impacts how easy it is to achieve watertightness.

### PETG: The Best Choice for Watertight Prints

PETG is the standout winner for watertight applications. Its naturally excellent layer adhesion means fewer gaps form during printing. The material is also inherently water-resistant and won't absorb moisture over time like some filaments do.

PETG's slight flexibility helps too—the material naturally wants to bond with itself, creating more complete seals between extrusion lines. If you're serious about making something hold water, start with PETG.

### PLA: Works With Extra Effort

PLA can be made watertight, but it requires more aggressive settings and often post-processing. The material doesn't bond between layers quite as well as PETG, and PLA slowly absorbs water over time (it's hygroscopic), which can degrade prints used for long-term water contact.

For temporary applications or with proper sealing, PLA works fine. For anything holding water long-term, PETG is the better choice.

### ABS and ASA: Good Performance, Higher Difficulty

Both ABS and ASA can produce watertight prints, and they offer excellent water resistance once printed. ABS has the added benefit of acetone vapor smoothing, which can seal surface imperfections chemically.

The downside: both materials are harder to print successfully than PETG, requiring enclosures and careful temperature management. Unless you specifically need their properties, PETG gets you similar results with less hassle.

At Mandarin3D, we work primarily with PLA and PETG on our BambuLab P1S and H2S printers. For watertight applications, we typically recommend PETG—it gives our customers the best results without requiring extensive post-processing.

## Print Settings That Actually Seal

Getting your slicer settings right is where watertight printing is won or lost. Here's what to adjust:

### Walls: More Is More

The number of perimeter walls is the single most important factor for watertightness. More walls mean more chances for the plastic to completely seal.

**Recommended settings:**
- Minimum 4 perimeters (wall loops)
- Preferably 5-6 for critical applications
- Wall thickness of at least 1.6mm, ideally 2.0mm+

Why so many? With only 2-3 perimeters, any slight underextrusion or gap between lines creates a path for water. With 4-6 perimeters, even if one line doesn't bond perfectly, the adjacent ones fill the gap.

### Layer Height: Go Lower

Thinner layers bond better. Each layer has more contact area relative to its volume, and the melted plastic penetrates further into the layer below.

**Recommended settings:**
- 0.12mm to 0.2mm layer height
- 0.16mm is a good balance between quality and print time
- Avoid 0.28mm+ for watertight applications

Testing shows that 0.1mm layers significantly outperform 0.3mm layers for water retention—the difference is dramatic.

### Extrusion: Slight Over-Extrusion Helps

Here's a trick that makes a real difference: intentionally over-extrude slightly. This fills gaps that would otherwise let water through.

**Recommended settings:**
- Flow rate: 102-105% (start at 103%)
- Extrusion width: 10-15% wider than nozzle diameter
- Line overlap: Increase to 25-35% where perimeters meet infill

Be careful not to go too high—excessive over-extrusion causes surface quality issues and potential nozzle clogs. Start conservative and increase only if needed.

### Temperature: Run Hot

Higher temperatures improve layer bonding by giving the plastic more time to flow and merge with the layer below.

**Recommended settings:**
- Print temperature: 5-10°C above your normal settings
- For PETG: Try 240-245°C instead of the usual 230-235°C
- For PLA: Try 215-220°C instead of 200-210°C

The tradeoff is increased stringing and potentially worse overhangs, but for watertight containers, sealing trumps surface perfection.

### Infill: High Density Required

While walls do most of the sealing work, your top and bottom surfaces depend on infill for support. Low infill leaves gaps.

**Recommended settings:**
- Minimum 50% infill for watertight parts
- 100% infill for pressure vessels or parts that must hold water under any stress
- Grid or cubic patterns bond better than lines
- At least 5-6 top and bottom layers (these form the actual water barrier)

### Cooling: Reduce It

Less part cooling means the plastic stays molten longer, improving interlayer bonding. This is the opposite of what you'd do for appearance-focused prints.

**Recommended settings:**
- Part cooling fan: 30-50% (not the usual 100%)
- First few layers: No cooling at all
- Only increase for severe overhangs

## Design Strategies for Watertight Parts

Good design makes watertight printing much easier. Here's how to set yourself up for success:

### Eliminate Overhangs and Bridges

Overhangs and bridges are the weakest points for water sealing. The drooping plastic doesn't bond as well, creating guaranteed leak paths.

**Design approach:**
- Keep overhangs under 45°
- Avoid flat horizontal bridges where possible
- Consider splitting your model to print problematic areas at better orientations
- Add chamfers instead of sharp horizontal transitions

### Solid Floors and Ceilings

The bottom and top of any container should be completely solid. Those first and last few layers are your primary water barrier.

**Design approach:**
- Ensure floor thickness matches your planned bottom layer count
- A floor at least 1.5mm thick with 6+ bottom layers is reliable
- Same principle for lids and tops

### Think About Print Orientation

Orientation matters because layer lines are the weak points for water penetration.

**Design approach:**
- Orient parts so water pressure pushes against the walls, not along layer lines
- For a cup, printing upright (opening at top) puts the layers perpendicular to where water would try to escape—good
- Printing that same cup on its side puts layer lines running vertically along the walls—water will find paths between layers

### Consider Gaskets and Seals

For parts with lids or joints, printed seals can help—but often aren't enough on their own.

**Design approach:**
- TPU gaskets can seal joints between rigid printed parts
- Design grooves for O-rings where true sealing is critical
- Remember that 3D printed thread connections rarely seal without additional measures

## Post-Processing: When Print Settings Aren't Enough

Sometimes the print alone won't achieve complete watertightness. These post-processing methods work:

### Epoxy Coating

Brushing or pouring epoxy over your print creates a complete seal. This is the most reliable method for guaranteed watertightness.

**How to apply:**
- Clean the print thoroughly
- Apply thin, even coats (2-3 coats recommended)
- Use food-safe epoxy if the item will contact consumables
- Allow full cure time (usually 24-72 hours)

Epoxy also strengthens your print and gives a glossy finish. The downside: it changes the surface appearance and adds curing time to your project.

### Silicone Sealant

For sealing specific areas—joints, seams, or internal channels—silicone works well.

**How to apply:**
- Apply to the target area with a small brush or syringe
- Smooth with a gloved finger for even coverage
- Clear silicone is nearly invisible after curing
- Food-safe options available

Silicone is particularly useful for sealing threaded connections or joints between multiple parts.

### Acrylic Varnish/Spray Sealant

The easiest option: spray-on sealants create a thin waterproof layer.

**How to apply:**
- Apply 2-3 light coats
- Cover both inside and outside for containers
- Available in matte or gloss finishes
- Quick drying (minutes vs. hours for epoxy)

This works well for decorative items like vases where you want quick results without changing the appearance much.

### Vapor Smoothing (ABS Only)

If you're printing in ABS, acetone vapor smoothing melts the surface layer, sealing micro-gaps chemically.

**How it works:**
- Suspend the print over acetone in a sealed container
- Vapors melt the surface slightly
- Results in a sealed, glossy finish
- Only works on ABS—acetone has no effect on PLA or PETG

This is an advanced technique requiring proper safety precautions (acetone is flammable and the vapors are harmful), but it produces excellent results for ABS parts.

## Testing Your Watertight Print

Before putting your print into service, test it:

**Basic test:** Fill with water, set on a paper towel, wait 30 minutes to an hour. Any dampness on the towel indicates leaks.

**Pressure test:** For containers that will see any pressure, submerge the print and gently squeeze or apply pressure. Watch for bubbles.

**Dye test:** Add food coloring to the water. Colored water makes tiny leaks visible that clear water might not reveal.

**Long-term test:** For critical applications, let water sit in the print for 24+ hours. Some leaks only develop over time.

## Practical Applications

With these techniques, here's what you can successfully print:

- **Vases and planters** (inner liner recommended for plants)
- **Soap dishes and bathroom accessories**
- **Pet water bowls** (with food-safe coating)
- **Electronics enclosures** for humid environments
- **Hydroponic system components**
- **Custom aquarium accessories**
- **Garden tool holders and outdoor containers**

{/* Note: For food-contact items, always use food-safe materials and coatings. Standard 3D prints are not food-safe due to surface porosity and material concerns. */}

## Getting Help With Watertight Prints

Watertight printing takes experimentation—settings that work perfectly for one model might need tweaking for another. The shape, size, and intended use all factor in.
