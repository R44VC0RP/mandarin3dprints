Not everything fits on a print bed. And even when it does, sometimes you're better off printing in pieces anyway. Whether you're creating a prop larger than your printer, designing functional mechanisms with moving parts, or just want better surface quality by controlling print orientation—knowing how to design for assembly is a fundamental 3D printing skill.

Here's everything you need to know about splitting models, choosing connection methods, and designing parts that actually fit together.

## Why Print in Multiple Parts?

Before diving into techniques, let's address when multi-part printing makes sense:

**Size constraints.** Our BambuLab P1S printers have a 256 × 256 × 256mm build volume. The H2S extends to 340mm in height. Anything larger needs to be split.

**Better print quality.** By splitting a model, you can orient each piece for optimal surface quality and minimal supports. A complex figurine might print as a mess in one piece but look fantastic as five well-oriented parts.

**Material combinations.** Need a rigid body with a flexible grip? Print them separately and assemble.

**Easier post-processing.** Painting, sanding, and finishing are often simpler on smaller, separated components.

**Functional assemblies.** Moving parts, mechanisms, and anything with tight tolerances often print better when fabricated as separate pieces.

## Choosing Where to Split

The split location matters enormously. A bad split creates weak joints, visible seams, and assembly headaches. A good split is invisible and makes the print easier.

**Natural break points.** Look for existing geometry that hides seams—where two colors meet, along panel lines, at the base of a neck or limb, or where different textures transition.

**Flat surfaces.** Splits along flat planes are easiest to align, glue, and sand. Curved or complex split lines require more precision and are harder to hide.

**Structural considerations.** Avoid splitting through load-bearing areas. If your part will experience stress, the joint shouldn't be at the weakest point.

**Print orientation opportunities.** Consider how each resulting piece will sit on the build plate. A split that lets both halves print without supports is worth a visible seam.

**Access for finishing.** If interior surfaces need painting or other treatment, splits that allow access before final assembly save frustration.

## Connection Methods: Picking the Right Joint

There's no single "best" connection method—it depends on whether you need the joint permanent or removable, load-bearing or decorative, visible or hidden.

### Glue Joints (Permanent)

The simplest approach: flat surfaces that get glued together.

**Best for:** Decorative models, props, anything that won't see mechanical stress.

**Design tips:**
- Leave surfaces slightly rough—sanding to around 220 grit gives adhesive more grip
- Add registration features (pins, lips, or keys) to ensure alignment during glue-up
- Allow 0.1–0.2mm clearance for the adhesive layer

**Adhesive selection:**
- Cyanoacrylate (super glue): Fast, strong, works on most filaments
- Epoxy: Slower cure but excellent for load-bearing joints
- Plastic welding: For ABS, acetone creates molecular bonds stronger than the base material

### Pin-and-Hole Connections

Simple cylindrical pins that fit into matching holes. This is the "LEGO approach" and works incredibly well.

**Best for:** Assemblies that need alignment but will be glued, or semi-permanent connections.

**Design specifications:**
- Pin diameter: 3–5mm works well for most applications
- Hole depth: 5–10mm provides adequate grip
- Tolerance: Design pins 0.2–0.3mm smaller than holes for easy insertion
- Chamfer the pin ends for easier assembly

**Pro tip:** Add a flat along one side of the pin (making it D-shaped) to allow air and excess glue to escape during assembly.

### Dovetail Joints

A staple of woodworking that translates perfectly to 3D printing. The angled interlocking shape resists pulling apart.

**Best for:** Parts that slide together and need to stay put, or joints that shouldn't separate in one direction.

**Design specifications:**
- Dovetail angle: 10–15 degrees from vertical works well
- Tolerance: 0.2–0.3mm clearance on mating surfaces
- Consider draft angles—parts should pull tighter as they're pressed together

Dovetails are particularly useful for prints that might experience stress, as the geometry provides mechanical hold even without adhesive.

### Snap-Fit Joints

Snap-fits use elastic deformation to lock parts together. A flexible hook deflects during insertion, then catches behind a ledge.

**Best for:** Assemblies that need to come apart, enclosures, battery covers, or anywhere you want tool-free access.

**Critical considerations:**
- **Material matters.** PLA is too brittle for repeated snap-fit cycles—use PETG, ABS, or nylon
- **Print orientation is critical.** Snap-fit features must print with layers parallel to the deflection direction, never perpendicular (or they'll shear along layer lines)
- **Tolerances:** Use 0.4–0.5mm clearance for FDM snap-fits

**Types of snap-fits:**
- **Cantilever:** A flexible arm with a hook—most common and versatile
- **Annular:** A circular ridge that snaps into a groove—great for caps and lids
- **Torsional:** Uses twisting motion—less common but useful for bayonet-style connections

### Heat-Set Inserts

Metal threaded inserts that you melt into the plastic using a soldering iron. They provide durable, reusable threads.

**Best for:** Parts that need repeated assembly/disassembly with screws, load-bearing connections, or anywhere you need metal threads.

**Design specifications:**
- Hole diameter: Use the manufacturer's recommended hole size (typically slightly smaller than the insert OD)
- Depth: Insert length plus 0.5–1mm
- Wall thickness: At least 2mm of material around the insert

Heat-set inserts turn flimsy printed threads into strong, reusable connections. They're invaluable for enclosures, mounts, and functional parts.

### Magnets

Embedded magnets provide invisible, tool-free connections that can be opened and closed repeatedly.

**Best for:** Access panels, removable covers, display pieces that need hidden connections.

**Design specifications:**
- Size pocket 0.1–0.2mm smaller than magnet for press-fit
- Include a small hole at the bottom of the pocket for air to escape
- Mark polarity during design—nothing's worse than magnets that repel

**Assembly tip:** Use a dab of superglue or carefully melt magnets into place with a soldering iron for permanent installation.

## Alignment Strategies

Getting parts to line up perfectly during assembly is half the battle. Build alignment into your design.

### Alignment Keys

Small protrusions that fit into matching recesses, ensuring parts can only go together one way.

**Design approach:**
- Asymmetric shapes prevent incorrect assembly
- 0.15–0.2mm clearance between key and keyway
- Bevel the leading edge of keys for easier insertion
- Place keys away from visible surfaces

### Stepped Joints

Instead of a flat split, create an overlapping step or lip. One part has a raised rim; the other has a matching recess.

**Benefits:**
- Larger glue surface area
- Automatic alignment in two axes
- Hides the seam (the visible line is in the recess)

**Design specifications:**
- Step depth: 1.5–2mm
- Step width: 3–5mm minimum for adequate glue surface
- Tolerance: 0.2mm clearance

### Registration Marks

When precise alignment is critical but adding physical features isn't practical, design small marks or notches that you can align visually or with a straightedge during assembly.

## Tolerances for Assembly

Getting tolerances right is crucial. Too tight and parts won't fit; too loose and they'll be sloppy.

**General tolerance guidelines for FDM:**

| Connection Type | Clearance |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Press-fit (permanent) | 0.0–0.1mm |
| Snug fit (minimal play) | 0.15–0.25mm |
| Normal assembly | 0.2–0.3mm |
| Easy assembly / moving parts | 0.3–0.5mm |
| Snap-fit joints | 0.4–0.5mm |

**Variables that affect tolerances:**
- **Material:** PETG shrinks slightly more than PLA
- **Temperature:** Both printing and ambient temperature matter
- **Part size:** Larger parts accumulate more dimensional error
- **Printer calibration:** Every machine is slightly different

**Testing approach:** Before committing to a final design, print a simple test piece with your key joint at several tolerances (0.2mm, 0.3mm, 0.4mm). A 15-minute test print can save hours of reprinting.

## Splitting Large Models: A Practical Workflow

When you need to break down a model larger than your build volume, follow this process:

1. **Analyze the geometry.** Identify natural split points, structural concerns, and surface-quality requirements.

2. **Choose your cuts.** Use CAD software (Fusion 360, Meshmixer, or Blender) to make clean planar cuts.

3. **Add alignment features.** Insert keys, pins, or stepped joints along the split planes.

4. **Label parts.** For complex assemblies, add small embossed numbers or letters to each piece—you'll thank yourself during assembly.

5. **Consider print orientation.** Orient each resulting piece for optimal quality and minimal supports.

6. **Test fit.** If possible, do a quick test print of just the joint area before committing to full parts.

## Assembly Tips

Even well-designed parts need careful assembly:

**Dry fit first.** Always test-fit before applying adhesive. File or sand tight spots.

**Prepare surfaces.** Light sanding (220–400 grit) improves glue adhesion.

**Use clamps.** Rubber bands, tape, and actual clamps keep parts aligned while adhesive cures.

**Work clean.** Remove stringing and surface debris before assembly.

**Mind the glue squeeze-out.** Apply adhesive sparingly and have acetone or alcohol ready for cleanup.

**Be patient.** Let adhesive fully cure before handling or stress-testing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Ignoring print orientation for joints.** Snap-fits, pins, and thin features printed in the wrong orientation will fail.

**Too-tight tolerances.** It's easier to add glue to a loose joint than to sand a tight one.

**Forgetting material shrinkage.** Parts printed at different times or with different materials may not match perfectly.

**Overcomplicating joints.** Sometimes a simple glue joint beats an elaborate interlocking mechanism.

**Not testing.** A quick test print of your joint design saves time and material.

## Bringing It Together

Designing for assembly is really about thinking ahead. Consider how parts will come together while you're still in CAD, not after you've printed something that doesn't fit.

The techniques aren't complicated: proper tolerances, appropriate joints, strategic splits, and alignment features. What makes the difference is applying them deliberately to your specific project.
