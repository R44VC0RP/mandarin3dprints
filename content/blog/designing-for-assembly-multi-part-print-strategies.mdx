Every 3D printer has limits. Build volume, overhang angles, support accessibility—eventually, you'll design something that simply won't fit on the bed in one piece. That's not a problem. It's an opportunity to think strategically about how your parts come together.

Multi-part printing isn't just about working around size constraints. Done well, it produces stronger parts, better surface quality, and easier post-processing than trying to force everything into a single print. Here's how to approach multi-part design like a pro.

## When to Split Your Model

Before reaching for the virtual saw, consider whether splitting actually makes sense for your project.

**Split when:**
- Your model exceeds the build volume (our BambuLab P1S printers have a 256×256×256mm build area)
- Large overhangs would require extensive, hard-to-remove supports
- Different sections need different materials (rigid body with flexible grips, for example)
- Printing in one piece would create trapped voids or inaccessible areas
- You want better surface quality on all visible faces

**Don't split when:**
- The model already fits and prints cleanly in one piece
- Structural integrity is critical and joints would create weak points
- Assembly tolerance requirements are tighter than your printing accuracy

The goal isn't to make more parts—it's to make better parts.

## Choosing Where to Cut

The placement of your splits matters more than you might think. A well-placed cut creates parts that print easily and join invisibly. A poorly placed cut creates weak spots, visible seams, and assembly headaches.

### Follow Natural Boundaries

Look for existing edges, seams, or geometric transitions in your design. If you're printing a character figure, split at the neck, wrists, and waist—places where clothing or anatomy already creates a visual break. For mechanical parts, split along flanges, shoulders, or where components would naturally separate.

Cuts along existing features hide better than cuts through smooth surfaces.

### Maximize Print Quality

Think about how each piece will sit on the print bed. Splits that let you place the most important surfaces face-down (against the bed) or face-up (top layer finish) produce the best results. Vertical walls with layer lines are the lowest-quality surfaces—position splits so these end up hidden inside the assembly.

### Strengthen, Don't Weaken

Layer lines are the weak point in FDM prints. When possible, orient splits so assembled parts load across layers rather than along them. A joint that runs perpendicular to the primary stress direction adds minimal weakness. A joint parallel to the stress direction creates a failure point.

For structural parts, consider diagonal or stepped cuts rather than straight ones. More surface area means more glue contact and a stronger bond.

## Alignment Methods That Actually Work

Once you've cut your model, the pieces need to go back together accurately. Nothing ruins a multi-part print like a visible step or offset at the seams.

### Pin and Socket Joints

The most reliable alignment method uses pins on one part that fit into matching holes on the other. This is the 3D printing equivalent of dowel joints in woodworking.

**Dimensions that work:**
- Pin diameter: 3-5mm for most applications
- Pin height: 5-10mm (longer provides better alignment but requires deeper holes)
- Socket depth: Pin height plus 1-2mm (for glue reservoir)
- Tolerance: Make sockets 0.2-0.3mm larger than pins for a snug fit

**Pro tip:** Instead of printing separate pins, use pieces of filament as alignment dowels. Design 1.75mm holes in both parts, then insert a short piece of leftover filament when you glue up. Perfect fit every time, zero extra printing.

### Interlocking Geometry

For parts that need to align precisely and stay together without adhesive during assembly (useful for test fitting), design interlocking features:

**Tongue and groove:** One part has a protruding ridge, the other has a matching channel. Simple to model, provides alignment in two axes.

**Dovetail joints:** Angled tongue-and-groove joints that can only slide together from one direction, then lock in place. More work to model but provide excellent alignment and mechanical strength.

**Puzzle cuts:** Wavy or irregular cut lines that mesh together. Useful for splitting flat surfaces like panels or bases where a straight line would be visible.

### Flat Surface with Keys

The simplest approach: flat mating surfaces with small geometric keys (squares, triangles, or circles) that ensure correct orientation. Easy to add in any CAD software—just extrude a small shape from one surface and create a matching pocket in the other.

This method works fine for decorative items where structural strength comes from adhesive rather than the joint geometry.

## Joining Methods by Application

How you connect your parts depends on what you're building.

### Super Glue (Cyanoacrylate) – Quick and Easy

Best for: Small parts, PLA, quick assemblies
Strength: Good for light-duty applications
Working time: Seconds

CA glue is the go-to for most 3D printing assembly work. It bonds PLA well and sets almost instantly. Use gel formulations for better control—liquid CA runs everywhere.

**Tips for stronger CA bonds:**
- Lightly sand mating surfaces with 220-grit sandpaper
- Clean with isopropyl alcohol to remove oils and dust
- Apply sparingly—excess glue weakens the joint
- Hold parts firmly for 30 seconds; full cure takes 24 hours

For gap-filling on imperfect joints, sprinkle baking soda into liquid CA. It creates an instant hard filler that sands well.

### Epoxy – Maximum Strength

Best for: Structural parts, PETG, load-bearing assemblies
Strength: Often stronger than the printed material itself
Working time: 5-60 minutes depending on formulation

Two-part epoxy creates the strongest bonds available for 3D prints. The chemical cure produces a rigid joint that can handle significant stress.

**When to use epoxy:**
- Parts will bear weight or experience repeated forces
- PETG parts (which don't bond as well with CA)
- Gap-filling is needed for imperfect fits
- Waterproofing is required

J-B Weld's plastic-specific formula works well on both PLA and PETG. Mix thoroughly and give it the full cure time—rushing epoxy joints drastically reduces strength.

### Solvent Welding – Invisible Seams

Best for: ABS and ASA parts, cosmetic applications
Strength: Excellent—creates a true chemical bond
Working time: Variable

Solvent welding uses chemicals to partially dissolve the plastic surfaces, which then fuse as the solvent evaporates. The result is a molecular bond rather than adhesion—essentially welding the parts together.

For ABS: Acetone or ABS slurry (ABS dissolved in acetone)
For PETG: 3D Gloop or Weld-On 16

**Warning:** Solvent welding requires good ventilation. These chemicals are nasty to breathe. Work in a well-ventilated area or outside.

### Mechanical Fasteners – Serviceable Connections

Best for: Parts that need disassembly, high-stress applications, mixed material assemblies
Strength: Depends on fastener selection
Working time: N/A

Sometimes glue isn't the answer. Mechanical fasteners—screws, bolts, heat-set inserts—create serviceable connections you can take apart later.

**Heat-set inserts** are brass threaded fittings that you press into undersized holes using a soldering iron. They provide strong, reusable threads in plastic parts. Design holes 0.1-0.2mm smaller than the insert's outer diameter.

**Self-tapping screws** work directly in plastic but can strip with repeated use. Best for parts assembled once or twice.

**Through-bolts** with nuts are the strongest mechanical connection but require access to both sides of the assembly.

## Material Considerations

Different filaments behave differently in multi-part assemblies.

### PLA
- Bonds well with CA glue
- Somewhat brittle—joints can crack under impact
- Best for decorative items and light-duty applications
- Avoid epoxy unless necessary (CA works fine and is easier)

### PETG
- Lower surface energy makes bonding trickier
- CA works but epoxy is more reliable for structural applications
- 3D Gloop creates excellent chemical bonds
- Good choice for parts that need some flex at joints

### TPU (Flexible)
- Doesn't bond well with anything
- Use mechanical interlocks—design parts that physically capture the TPU
- Extra tolerance needed (0.3-0.5mm) since flexible parts are harder to position accurately

## Surface Preparation

The secret to strong joints isn't fancy adhesives—it's proper surface prep.

1. **Sand the mating surfaces** with 150-220 grit sandpaper. This removes the glossy layer and creates texture for adhesive to grip.

2. **Clean thoroughly** with isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher). Oils from your hands, dust from sanding, and residue from printing all weaken bonds.

3. **Dry completely** before applying adhesive. Moisture defeats most glues.

4. **Test fit first.** Dry-assemble everything to make sure parts align correctly. You don't want to discover a problem while glue is setting.

5. **Clamp or fixture** during cure. Even "instant" adhesives benefit from holding parts in position for proper alignment.

## Hiding the Seams

Once assembled, you might want to make joints invisible.

**For painted parts:** Fill gaps with CA glue and baking soda, or use automotive body filler. Sand smooth, then prime and paint. The seam will completely disappear.

**For bare plastic:** Careful placement of joints along natural edges is your best bet. On flat surfaces, use puzzle cuts rather than straight lines—irregular seams are less visible than geometric ones.

**For functional parts:** Don't worry about it. Visible seams on mechanical components are expected.

## Putting It Into Practice

Here's a practical workflow for a project that exceeds your build volume:

1. **Analyze the model** in your CAD software. Identify the largest dimension and natural split points.

2. **Plan your cuts** to create pieces that each fit within your build volume with room to spare (leave 10-15mm margin for any warping).

3. **Add alignment features**—pins, keys, or interlocking geometry at each joint.

4. **Export each piece** as a separate file, clearly named (PartA-Bottom, PartA-Top, etc.).

5. **Print with consistent settings** across all parts. Variations in temperature or flow will create dimensional differences that show up at joints.

6. **Dry fit everything** before any glue touches the parts.

7. **Assemble in stages** if you have many parts. Let each joint cure fully before adding more pieces—this prevents stress from accumulated tolerance errors.

8. **Finish as needed** with sanding, filling, and painting.
